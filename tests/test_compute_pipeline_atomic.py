"""A compute program's pipeline is read and published atomically in vk_draw.cpp.

The dispatch's build worker, the dispatch itself and the precompile's threads write Program::compute_pipeline while other
recording threads read it (dispatch() reads it before taking ParLock). Plain reads and writes of it there were a data
race. Every use of it in vk_draw.cpp now goes through std::atomic_ref (release stores, acquire loads), and the
synchronous build makes the pipeline into a local and publishes it only once made.
